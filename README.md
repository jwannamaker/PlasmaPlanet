# PolyPlasmaPlanet
## just some more game programming! This time I'm using Pyglet.
  
    I'm a new follower in the cult of done.
    and this github account shall hence forth be a testiment to that.

- ### Status report: Tuesday 4/23/24
  - I decided I want this game to have that special ***Polished Aesthetics Deal*** which means a few things:
      1. Palette palette palette!
         - There's a big emphasis on this when it comes to how a game looks and feels.
         - I looked to Lospec to guide me, and added the colors I enjoyed to `palette.json`
      2. Art style!
          - Pixel art! Exercise my KISS bone! (referring to my new favorite mantra: "Keep it simple, stupid.")
          - Pixel art is *cool*.
          - Upon the realization that hand drawing (or even computer aided) would be FAR too tedious I did what any good programmer does best--I wrote up `pixel_art_generator.py`, a script that generates sprite sheet and images for regular polygons using the color palettes I defined in a separate file. Pictured here is the encouraging results of that endeavor!
